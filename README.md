# Personal Notes App

This is a simple and functional web-based Personal Notes App that allows users to create, edit, and delete personal notes. The app leverages localStorage to save notes, ensuring they persist even after the page is refreshed.
**Key Features**:
* **Add Notes**: Users can enter new notes using a text input field.
* **Edit Notes**: Each note can be edited directly in the app. Once edited, the new content is saved automatically.
* **Delete Notes**: Notes can be removed from the list with a click of a trash icon.
* **Persistent Storage**: Notes are stored locally using the browserâ€™s localStorage so that even after a page reload, users can view their saved notes.

**Technologies Used**:
* **HTML**: Basic page structure and form creation for user input.
* **CSS**: Simple styling with user-friendly input fields, buttons, and interactive icons.
* **JavaScript**: DOM manipulation to dynamically display, edit, and delete notes, with localStorage integration for persistence.
* **Bootstrap Icons**: Used for editing and deleting notes with intuitive icons.

**How It Works**:
* **Add a Note**: Enter the note content in the input field and click the "Submit" button to add it to the list.
* **Edit a Note**: Each note has an edit option, enabling users to modify the content of the note directly.
* **Delete a Note**: Notes can be deleted by clicking the trash icon next to each note.
* **Persistence**: Notes are saved in localStorage and reappear when the page is reloaded.

This project demonstrates core web development skills, including working with HTML forms, CSS for layout and styling, and JavaScript for dynamic content and client-side storage.
